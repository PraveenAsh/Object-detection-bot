# AIBOD [Arduino Interfacing Bot for Obstacle Detection]

> This project involves the building of an autonomous robot that can detect and avoid obstacles and can also detect and avoid edge of a surface on which it is placed. This is achieved by two ultrasonic sensors, one placed on a servo for edge detection and another placed at the bottom of the robot, facing downwards, for edge detection.
